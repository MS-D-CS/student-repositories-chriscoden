<br><p>Hi my name is chris and im starting to learn how to code and make websites and its pretty cool to see the end product after all of the work that is put into it if needed to be contacted the main email that I use is mcmahan.christopher@yahoo.com</p></br>
<p>the course that i am taking is called web design and it is a lot of work but once you get the hang
   of it, it gets a lot easier after the moths of learning how to code its been fun but also difficult to stay on task because i am eaisly distracted.
</p>
<br><p>The main thing for this website is for me to keep track on what i have been learning and when and how it was helpful to me when i code.</p>
